Docker simulation stack
==========================

We have created a [Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/) which contains all of the major components of the simulation stack we have built so far (including [Sibernetic](../sibernetic/) and [c302](../c302/)). It can be used to run a preliminary model of the worm in 3D on your computer.
