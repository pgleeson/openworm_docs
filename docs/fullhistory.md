A History and Pre-History of OpenWorm
=====================================

What follows is a history of _C. elegans_ research, of the OpenWorm Project, as well as of several similar projects.

Historical Milestones
---------------------

1900: _C. elegans_ was [first described](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans) by **Ã‰mile Maupas**, who isolated it from soil in Algeria.

1963: **Sydney Brenner**, at MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, [**proposed using _C. elegans_ as a model organism**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans) for scientific study. He won a Nobel prize for this work in 2002.

1986: After thirteen years of work, **John White**, also at MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, [publishes the full _C. elegans_ connectome](https://wormatlas.org/MoW_built0.92/MoW.html).

1999: _C. elegans_ becomes the first animal [to have its genome completely sequenced](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/data/worm-genome/#:~:text=Caenorhabditis%20genome%20sequencing-,C.,legacies%20of%20the%20institute%20itself.). Humans follow in 2002.

1999: **Ferree and Lockery** publish a [neural network model of chemotaxis in _C. elegans_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10406137)

2000: [**WormBase**](http://www.wormbase.org/about#0--10) is [founded](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/suppl_1/D463.abstract) by Paul Sternberg of CalTech and Richard Durbin, among others. It aggregates information known about _C. elegans_ into one place.

2002: **David Harel** proposes complete modeling of the _C. elegans_ as a [grand challenge in computing](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24622-0_26).

2009: **Boyle & Cohen** publish an [integrated 2D computer model of _C. elegans_ locomotion](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/1377/)

18 May 2014: [A team from MIT develops a technique to **view all _C. elegans_ neurons at once**](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2964.html), which may fill in a remaining data gap.

OpenWorm
--------

Fall of 2007: Andrey Palyanov starts the CyberElegans project.

~2007: Co-founders Giovanni Idili and Matteo Cantarelli (software engineers) have conversations about simulating the worm, but nothing comes of it at the time as they lack computational biology / neuroscience background.

June 2008: First CyberElegans publication: Palyanov A.Yu., Dibert A.A., Computer simulation of _C. elegans_ muscular system and neural network // In: Proc. 6-th Int. Conf. Bioinformatics of Genome Regulation and Structure (BGRS), June 22-28, 2008, p. 61.

~2009: Andrey Palyanov posts the first CyberElegans video to youtube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek49JSAiKjY>

Jan 2010: Sergey Khayrulin joins Andrey on the CyberElegans project.

1 Jan 2010: In [the tweet heard 'round the world](https://x.com/John_Idol/status/7279117575), co-founder [Giovanni Idili](http://twitter.com/john_idol) **proposes what would later be called the OpenWorm project** to co-founder Stephen Larson (PhD student at UCSD) at the [Whole Brain Catalog](http://twitter.com/BrainCatalog):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/BrainCatalog">@BrainCatalog</a> new year&#39;s resolution: simulate the whole <em>C. elegans</em> brain (302 neurons)!</p>&mdash; Giovanni Idili (@John_Idol) <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Idol/status/7279117575">January 1, 2010</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Nice!

3 August 2010: In a [five-minute speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb1V_OKqRfc), Stephen Larson pitches the idea for simulating _C. elegans_ at Ignite San Diego. 

Early Jan 2011: Stephen Larson puts out a call for volunteers through Whole Brain Catalog, originally oriented at finding contributors for the WBC platform. Giovanni replies to the call restating his goal of _C. elegans_ simulation, and brings Matteo into the conversation. The 3 get together on a skype call and decide to start a project together, during this conversation **Stephen proposes the name "OpenWorm" and the name sticks**. Subsequent early days conversations include Timothy Busbice (who also replied to Stephen's call for volunteers and co-founded OpenWorm), Marius Buibas (UCSD at the time) and Jay Coggan (Salk Institute).

24 Jan 2011: Giovanni discovers **CyberElegans**, developed by **Andrey Palyanov** and **Sergey Khayrulin** (from AP Ershov Institute of Informatics, Russia) who are contacted and immediately agree to join forces with the OpenWorm team:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>WOW, this <em>C. elegans</em> simulation looks pretty impressive --&gt; http://goo.gl/SS96B cc: <a href="https://twitter.com/BrainCatalog">@BrainCatalog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tarelli">@tarelli</a></p>&mdash; Giovanni Idili (@John_Idol) <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Idol/status/29603680760111104">January 24, 2011</a></blockquote>

Projects similar to OpenWorm
----------------------------

Detailed [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NclOVMRIqY\_hn-aL8MdLlJrfuhDgNJyk\_ChsZMjugmE/edit?usp=sharing) of these models and their attributes. 

~1997: **NemaSys at University of Oregon** A full model was planned, including body, every neuron, every synapse, and complete set of sensory modalities. Four papers were released in 1997-1998 on pieces of the model, but its ultimate ambition was not finished. [Webpage link](http://www.csi.uoregon.edu/projects/celegans/)

~1998 **Perfect _C. elegans_ Project in Tokyo** They released an [initial report](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/106454698568495\#.VDrtDfldV8E), but no more.

~2004 **Virtual _C. elegans_ project at Hiroshima University, Japan** The aim was to build a worm emulation, simulate poking it on the head, and have it back away from the poke. This was achieved, but not in a biologically realistic way. They simulated the nematode neurons, but the connection weights were unknown. Instead of getting this information experimentally, a machine learning algorithm was used to generate weights. Papers:

-   [A Dynamic Body Model of _C. elegans_ with Neural Oscillators](http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf)
-   [A Model of Motor Control of _C. elegans_ with Neuronal Circuits](http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf)

2009 **Jordan Boyle, Netta Cohen at University of Leeds, UK** [_C. elegans_ locomotion: an integrated approach](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/1377/)

2010 **Mailler at Tulsa, USA** [A Biologically Accurate 3D Model of the Locomotion of Caenorhabditis Elegans](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228374526_A_Biologically_Accurate_3D_Model_of_the_Locomotion_of_Caenorhabditis_Elegans).

September 2011 - October 2013 **[Project Nemaload](http://nemaload.davidad.org/) ([David Dalrymple](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/144/26))**. The aim was to use optogenetics to record the firing dynamics of the _C. elegans_ neurons and then replicate it in a simulation. [He delivered a lecture on the project in November 2011](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW77lANeJas). As of June 2014 [he works for Twitter](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=66199655) so the project may now be defunct.
